## Folder Structure
### assign_purity_and_clonality
Contains code in a qmd file to assign purity and clonality for each mutation. 

### clonality_matcher
Contains code in a qmd file to match the same mutations between ENPP3lo and ENPP3hi cells, enabling downstream analysis of clonality relationship


## Input data
The code utilizes genetic data from a patient (ID: K416) as an example dataset for analysis
